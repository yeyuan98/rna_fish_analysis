# Snakemake workflow: 3D RNA-FISH cell type-specific analysis

This workflow combines AIRLOCALIZE (Lionnet et al.) and a minimal U-Net segmentation model to realize cell type-specific 3D RNA-FISH data analysis.

Our published work demonstrates this workflow with Drosophila clock neurons in vivo.

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing their published work (see above).
